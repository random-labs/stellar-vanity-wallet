## Q/A



**Why?**

Create a prefix/suffix to easily identify your wallet.  Easier to remember, harder to mess up.  Don't lose your lumens.

**How long does this take?**

It varies per machine, but single threaded performance is roughly:

* 1 character, instant
* 2 characters, ~15 seconds
* 3 chracters, 5~10 minutes
* 4 characters, 1-2 hours
* 5+ characters, ... coming soon

**Why are you giving me a mnemonic seed?**

I wanted to be able to generate a Ledger Nano S compatible seed (BIP39 24-word mnemonic).  So I used this to generate a vanity wallet (offline), to load into my Ledger.  **Not Recommended**

**Only single threaded, what is this crap?**

Use `parallel` yo.
